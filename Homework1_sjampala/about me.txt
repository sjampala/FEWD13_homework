About Me

Hello! My name is Somya Jampala (pronounce: Sonya with 'm'). I'm a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University's Interaction Design program, currently working as an interaction designer in San Francisco.

I love exploring opportunities in solving problems and my background in architecture, visual communication and interaction design has deeply formed my belief in human centered design process. I believe that design can address needs at a global level as well as bring delight in simple everyday interactions. 

When I'm not designing, I'm either crafting or cooking or hiking or teaching. Enthusiastic about traveling, I get most thoughts and ideas when I'm walking (or in motion!).
